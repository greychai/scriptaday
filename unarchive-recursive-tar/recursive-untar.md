# Recursive untar

A Bash script that unarchives .tar archives until there are none left in the directory.

## Case
I used this script when doing the test assignment for a DevOps Engineer position in a DevOps-as-a-Service company. Full text of the assignment was hidden in an "endless" (recursive) .tar archive.

## Usage

```bash
bash ./recursive-untar.sh archive.tar
```
